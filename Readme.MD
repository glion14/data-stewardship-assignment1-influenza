# Influenza predictions in Vienna (Data Stewardship TU Wien 2021)

# Description
The goal of this experiment was to model the relationship between weather observations and the prevalence of new influenza infections. 
It included reading, preparing and transforming data. 
Subsequently, these data were visualized and used for building a prediction model - we tried to predict influenza infections based on weather conditions.

This project is a part of Data Stewardship course at [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/en/).

## Technologies
We used Python with Jupyter notebook and `scikit-learn` for modeling. Visualization is handled by `seaborn` and `matplotlib`, 
while data manipulation is handled via `pandas`.
